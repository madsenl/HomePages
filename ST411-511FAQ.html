<h1> ST 411/511 Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p><strong>Can I get the syllabus?</strong></p>
<p>The Fall 2023 syllabus will be similar to the Fall 2022 syllabus. You can request a copy of the syllabus for any course from the <a href="mailto:Statistics.Office@oregonstate.edu">
Statistics Office</a>.</p>
<p><strong>I will need to miss a few classes. Will that be a problem?</strong></p>
<p>All materials will be available on the Canvas course site, including recordings of the lectures. Homework will be submitted online. You will need to travel to campus to take the in-class midterm and the final exam. Except for the exams, as long as you have a reliable internet connection, you should be able to keep up, even if you’re not physically on campus.</p>
<p><strong>I’ve never taken statistics before. Can I still take ST 411/511?</strong></p>
<p>The prerequisite is an introductory course such as ST 351. If you have not taken an introductory statistics course, then you are responsible for acquiring the background yourself. You should be familiar with t and Z hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. You should understand the following concepts: random sampling, probability distributions, normal curve, null hypothesis, p-value, and population vs. sample quantities. You should be familiar with the following population and sample quantities: mean, median, standard deviation, variance.</p>
<p><strong>I have no experience with R. Will I be able to keep up?</strong></p>
<p>ST 411/511 does not assume you have any programming experience. The labs and lectures will provide example R code, which you will be able to modify in order to complete the homework. You will not be asked to write R code on exams, though you will be expected to be able to interpret R output.</p>
<p><strong>I have a scheduling conflict and need an override.</strong></p>
<p>Please fill out the <a href="https://stat.oregonstate.edu/services/request-incompletes-overrides">override request form</a>. If you miss class, you can view the recording so you will not fall behind. You <strong>will</strong> need to attend ST 411/511 for the in-class midterm and for the final exam.</p>
<p><strong>The lab I need is full.</strong></p>
<p>Go ahead and register for a different lab. If it conflicts with your schedule, fill out an <a href="https://stat.oregonstate.edu/services/request-incompletes-overrides">override request form</a>. You can attend any lab, even if you're not registered for it.</p>
<p><strong>When will the final be?</strong></p>
<p>The Registrar establishes the final exam schedule, which they will post <a href="https://registrar.oregonstate.edu/final-examination-schedule-group-exams-class-meeting-hours">here</a> two weeks before the term begins.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
